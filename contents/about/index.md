description: Alex Normand - About me
template: about.jade

Hi, I’m Alex Normand, a 22 year old web developer located in Paris, France.
I’m currently an intern at [Crédit&nbsp;Agricole](http://www.credit-agricole.com/en)
where I work as a web developer as part of my Master’s degree. I’m a final year
student at University Paris Sud 11 Orsay where I’m studying for a Master of
science in computer science.

I'm passionate about web development. I'm particularly interested in
Web applications, the Mobile Web, Web standards, HTML5, JavaScript and all aspects of front-end development. I also enjoy 
back-end development using PHP, and I'm currently learning how to master the
[Symfony2](http://symfony.com/) framework. I've also started digging into [node.js](http://nodejs.org).
When I'm working on a project, I tend to focus on speed, minimalism, 
efficiency and usability.


I admire the work of [Paul Irish](http://paulirish.com/) and
[Steve Souders](http://stevesouders.com) (and many
[other developers](http://twitter.com/#!/normand_alex/following)...).

I'm an Open Source enthusiast and have been a happy [Debian GNU/Linux](http://www.debian.org/) 
user since the Debian Sarge release, and have done some Internationalization and translation work for the Debian project.


This site is powered by [Wintersmith](http://jnordberg.github.com/wintersmith/), an awesome static
website generator written in [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) which supports powerful  template languages
such as [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/).

or any job opportunities. <br/> Please feel free to contact me at: <mailto:anormnd@gmail.com>
