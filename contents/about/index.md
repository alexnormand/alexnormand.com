Hi, Iâ€™m Alex Normand, a Front-End Engineer at [Adobe](http://www.adobe.com) where I'm currently
working on [Adobe Marketing Cloud](http://www.adobe.com/solutions/digital-marketing.html).

I'm passionate about Web development. I'm particularly interested in
Web applications, the Mobile Web, Web standards, HTML5, JavaScript and all aspects of front-end development.
I also enjoy developing web applications with [node.js](http://nodejs.org)
and exploring the beauty and elegance of [streams](https://github.com/substack/stream-handbook).
When I'm working on a project, I tend to focus on speed, minimalism,
efficiency and usability.

This site is powered by [Wintersmith](http://jnordberg.github.com/wintersmith/), an awesome static
website generator written in [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) which supports powerful  template languages
such as [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/).
