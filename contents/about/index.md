Hi, Iâ€™m Alex Normand, a Software Engineer at [Adobe](https://www.adobe.com) where I'm currently
working on [Adobe Stock](https://stock.adobe.com/).

I'm passionate about Web development. I'm particularly interested in
Web applications, the Mobile Web, Web standards, HTML5, JavaScript and all aspects of Web development.
I also enjoy developing web applications with [node.js](https://nodejs.org)
and exploring the beauty and elegance of [streams](https://github.com/substack/stream-handbook).

When working on a project, I tend to focus on speed, minimalism, efficiency and usability.

Please feel free to contact me at: <mailto:alex@alexnormand.com>
