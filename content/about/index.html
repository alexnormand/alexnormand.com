description: Alex Normand - About me
---
Hi, I’m Alex Normand, a 22 year old web developer located in Paris, France.
I’m currently an intern at [Crédit&nbsp;Agricole](http://www.credit-agricole.com/en)
where I work as a web developer as part of my Master’s degree. I’m a final year
student at University Paris Sud 11 Orsay where I’m studying for a Master of
science in computer science.

I'm passionate about web developement, I'm particularly interested in
HTML5, JavaScript and all aspects of front-end development. I also enjoy 
back-end development using PHP, and I'm currently learning how to master the
[Symfony2](http://symfony.com/) framework. I focus on speed, minimalism, 
simplicity and efficiency.


This site is powered by [hyde](https://github.com/hyde/hyde), an awesome static
website generator written in python which supports powerful  template languages
such as [Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/).
read more about how I created this site [here](link).

I admire the work of [Paul Irish](http://paulirish.com/) and
[Steve Souders](http://stevesouders.com) (and many
[others](http://twitter.com/#!/normand_alex/following)...).

I have also been a happy Debian GNU/Linux user since the Debian Sarge release, 
and have done some internalization work for the debian project.
