<h3><a href="/blog/angry-post.html">An Angry Post</a></h3>
<p>To complete the character-study of Mr. Worple, he was a man of extremely
uncertain temper, and his general tendency was to think that Corky was a poor
chump and that whatever step he took in any direction on his own account, was
just another proof of his innate idiocy. I should imagine Jeeves feels very
much the same about&nbsp;me.</p>

<h3><a href="/blog/sad-post.html">A Sad Post</a></h3>
<p>I went and dressed sadly. It will show you pretty well how pipped I was when I
tell you that I near as a toucher put on a white tie with a dinner-jacket. I
sallied out for a bit of food more to pass the time than because I wanted it.
It seemed brutal to be wading into the bill of fare with poor old Bicky headed
for the&nbsp;breadline.</p>
